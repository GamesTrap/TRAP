# Discord Game SDK

## Installation

1. Get the version 2.5.6 of the Discord Game SDK from https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide.
2. Extract the contents of the discord_game_sdk.zip file into this folder.

If everything went right, feel free to use the TRAP::Utils::Discord namespace.

### Windows

The discord_game_sdk.dll file will be automatically copied to the .exe file's folder.

### Linux

The libdiscord_game_sdk.so file will be automatically copied to the executables folder.
