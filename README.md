# TRAP

![TRAP](Branding/TRAP.gif?raw=true "TRAP")

TRAPVK-Alpha is a cross-platform, high performance game engine currently in development.  
This README will be updated with more info eventually.

## Setup

### Requirements

TRAP Engine requires the [VulkanSDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)  
TRAP Engine requires a GPU that is Vulkan 1.2 or newer compatible.

First clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/GamesTrap/TRAP`.

> Note: If the repository has already been cloned non-recursively, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

TRAP uses _Premake 5_ as a build generation tool. Follow [these](https://premake.github.io/download.html) instructions in order to install it.  
Also make sure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and accessible via ```python3``` as it is needed by some scripts.

Then, execute one of the generator scripts in the GeneratorScripts folder.

## Updating Controller Mappings

To update the controller mappings run the `GenerateControllerMappings` file from the GeneratorScripts folder.

## Updating Vulkan Loader

To update the Vulkan Loader run the `GenerateVulkanLoader` file from the GeneratorScripts folder.

## Documentation

To generate the documentation run the `GenerateDocumentation` file from the GeneratorScripts folder.
